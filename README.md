# Movie Streaming React Web Apps

This application is a simple application to watch streaming movies like Netflix or DisneyPlus. The application is built with the laravel framework with reactjs support with user improvements. I am a Full-Stack Web Developer in developing this simple application. I made this application to practice react js with slicing from html using tailwind and for API using PHP with laravel 9 framework support.

Feature Apps: Login, Register, Dashboard Movie, Detail Movie and Subscription
